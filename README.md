# Abstract 

As smartphones have easy and exciting functionality that facilitate many things to human beings, including people with disabilities and especially people with hearing disabilities, who face the problem in understanding the written language of ordinary people. There are some solutions have been emerged for this problem; such as computer application that helps hearing impaired to learn signwriting, which is visual symbols that represents any sign language in the world and facilitates their communications, but they were not enough. In this project, we trying to solve the problems by proposing "Anamil Natiqa" game for Arab deaf and dumb people. The game consists in a memory match educational game which facilitates learning signwriting with an entertaining way, by matching words/numbers/pictures with their signwriting translations. To develop the game, we use agile software process because it focuses on high-quality development, testing, and collaboration. The game will help to spread signwriting and spread it among deaf and ordinary people. This would help to have better integration and communication of the deaf group in the society, as well as it will help deaf in their educational life.
